# Introducere-Robotica

This is a repository containing the homeworks for the "Introduction to Robotics" course, taken over the first semester of the third year of studies at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

Each homework will include the implemetation details and strategies and code, as well as physical requirements.

#Homework 1: Controlling an RGB LED using 3 potentiometers

Each potentiometer is associated with one of the colors.

Physical requirements:
  - Arduino Board
  - Breadboard
  - Potentiometer x3
  - RGB LED
  - Resistor x3
  - Wires
